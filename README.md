# Elm parcel template

## What is this?

- This is an Elm template which uses SCSS and Parcel (https://parceljs.org/) as its bundler.

## How to use this

- Clone from the repo.
- Use Yarn or NPM to install the node packages
- For Development - use `yarn dev` or `npm dev`. This will run a local development server on port `1234`
- For Production - use `yarn production` or `npm production`. This will use optimized bundling. Output is in `dist/` folder.
